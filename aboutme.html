            As you can tell, my name is Zeeshaan and I was born and raised in Oldham.
            <br>I am a graduate in BSc (Hons) Computer Games Technology at Manchester Metropolitan University.
            <br>I have experience in various programming languages and software that are used for programming as well 
            <br>as numerous game engines.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have customer communication experience which has developed with my time at as a sales assistant
            <br>and has developed further with my time as an artisan and a waiter at my current occupation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy playing most sports, with my current favourites being basketball, dodgeball and rugby. However
            <br> watching sports bores me incredibly.
